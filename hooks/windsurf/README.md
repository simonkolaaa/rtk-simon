# Windsurf (Cascade) Hooks

> Part of [`hooks/`](../README.md) — see also [`src/hooks/`](../../src/hooks/README.md) for installation code

## Specifics

- Prompt-level guidance only (no programmatic hook) -- relies on Windsurf Cascade reading rules files
- Installs `../rtk-awareness-full.md` (shared, agent-neutral): the instruction to prefix every shell command with `rtk`, plus meta commands. No hook, so the `full` level is always used regardless of `awareness.level`
- Installed to `.windsurfrules` (project-local, workspace-scoped) by `rtk init`
