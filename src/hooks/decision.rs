//! The single place RTK decides what a hook should do with a command.
//!
//! Three entry points ask the same question — may this command be rewritten,
//! and may the rewrite be auto-allowed?
//!
//! | Entry point | Verdict source | Identity rewrite |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `rtk hook <agent>` (`hook_cmd`) | `check_command_for(cmd, host)` | suppressed |
//! | `rtk rewrite` (`rewrite_cmd`, run as a subprocess by the shell/TS/Python delegates) | `check_command` (always `Host::Claude`) | reported |
//! | `rtk hook check` (`main.rs`) | whatever the named `--agent` consults, via [`AgentPath`] | suppressed |
//!
//! [`decide`] is the shared answer. What legitimately differs between callers
//! stays outside it: the verdict is passed in rather than looked up, so each
//! host consults its own permission rules and tests stay independent of the
//! machine's settings (#3146); the no-op-rewrite policy lives in
//! [`decide_for_agent`], which every hook shares and the CLI does not; and
//! whether the caller runs its own approval gate on the result lives in
//! [`ApprovalOwner`], which only ever relaxes the *default* ask.
