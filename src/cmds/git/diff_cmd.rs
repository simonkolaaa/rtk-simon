/// region; `None` means the stream disagreed with its own structure and the
/// caller must fall back to raw passthrough.
///
/// Detector precedence, total order — earlier rules own the line:
///
/// 1. Inside a hunk, the `@@` line budget owns every line. An invalid body
///    prefix, a budget over-consumed by one more body line, or EOF with
///    budget still owed → `None`. (Hunks close the moment the budget hits
///    zero, so a `@@` or file header arriving while a hunk is open is itself
///    budget-owed → the invalid-prefix arm returns `None`.) The
///    `\ No newline at end of file` marker consumes no budget. It describes
///    the line directly above it, so it is kept as content exactly when
///    that line was emitted — in-hunk after a `-`/`+` line, or on the line
///    right after the budget closed on one — because it is the only
///    witness of a newline-only change. After a context line, which the
///    output never carries, it is dropped: kept, it would sit under the
///    last marked line and describe the wrong one. A hunk that closes
///    with no `-`/`+` line at all is not a shape any unified-diff producer
///    emits (whitespace-ignoring modes suppress the hunk): it is
///    `--word-diff` / `--color-words` output whose inline markers sit
///    behind an indent, booked as context → `None`.
///    1b. The new-side marker lands on the line right after its hunk's
///    budget closed and is kept by the same test; a `\` line anywhere
///    else is prose (its text is localized, so position decides).
/// 2. An mbox `From <sha>` separator, an `hg export` changeset header
///    (`# HG changeset patch`) or an `hg log -p` `changeset:` line resets
///    to the prose prologue. The hg region differs in two ways: rule 6's
///    fact arms stay live in it (hg emits nothing that needs suppressing,
///    and a lost fact outranks a phantom entry), and hg's own `diff -r`
///    echo closes it (rule 3b) and counts as reaching its body — every hg
///    file gets one, binary files included.
/// 3. `diff --git` / `diff --cc` opens a file section (git extended headers
///    such as `rename`/`Binary files`/mode lines annotate it). `diff --git
///    X Y` names one path under two prefixes — `a/`/`b/` by default,
///    `i/`/`w/`/`c/`/`o/` under `diff.mnemonicPrefix`, anything under
///    `--src-prefix`/`--dst-prefix`, none under `--no-prefix` (X == Y) —
///    so the sides are split where they share a tail at a `/` boundary,
///    what precedes the tail on each side is that side's prefix, and the
///    header pair strips exactly those. `diff --cc` / `--combined` carry
///    one unprefixed path, kept whole. A section opened by `diff --git`
///    that closes with nothing behind it — no hunk, no note — is a stream
///    cut off right after its header (git never emits one) → `None`.
///    3b. A `diff -<opts> X Y` line that is not git's — GNU diff's per-file
///    echo when it compares directories, or hg's `diff -r <rev> [-r <rev>]
///    <file>` — is consumed as the mark of a `diff -r` stream (rule 9); it
///    is keyed on `diff -` because every echo carries an option and a
///    commit body line under `--format=%B` that starts with `diff ` does
///    not. Inside an mbox message region only hg's form is read; a
///    GNU-shaped echo there is prose, like rule 6's facts. hg's form also
///    closes an hg message region. After a GNU echo the roots diff was
///    given are directories, so header pairs keep them whole and the
///    roots are remembered for rule 6; hg prefixes `a/`/`b/` like git.
///    3c. svn's `Index: <path>` opens a file section; its `===` rule and
///    `svn:mime-type = …` lines are prose, `Cannot display: file marked as
///    a binary type.` is its binary note, and the header pair or `diff
///    --git` line that follows names it again. An `Index:` section that
///    closes with nothing parsed is a copy/move target svn has nothing to
///    show for — `(no content)` — unless a column-0 line was dropped
///    inside it, which is svn describing that file in words the parser
///    did not read → `None`. (Bound: an svn property change is a header
///    pair with no hunk followed by a `## -a,b +c,d ##` block, so rule 8
///    sends the stream raw — noise, not loss.)
/// 4. A `--- X` line immediately followed by `+++ Y` whose next line opens
///    a hunk — as every real producer's does — is a file header: it names
///    a still-hunkless section in place (unless git's `rename to`/`copy
///    to` already named it exactly), or opens a new section. A pair with
///    no hunk behind it is never consumed, open section or not: it falls
///    to rules 7-9, so stray marked lines are never swallowed as a phantom
///    header. The timestamp GNU diff, hg and svn append after a tab is
///    dropped first (the LAST tab, and only when timestamp-shaped, so a
///    bare tab in a name survives), then names are dequoted
///    (`core.quotepath` wraps a non-ASCII path in `"…"`), then the
///    prefixes the section's `diff --git` line settled are stripped — or,
///    for a pair on its own, `a/`/`b/` when the two names differ and
///    nothing when they repeat (`--no-prefix`) or the pair follows a GNU
///    echo (roots, not prefixes). This is what ends the prose prologue —
///    the prologue is positional (everything before the first file
///    header), never keyed on line values. (Bound: mbox prose quoting an unindented, well-formed
///    header-plus-hunk block still fabricates a phantom entry — noise, not
///    loss, since any budget disagreement in it falls back raw.)
/// 5. `@@` after a file header opens a hunk; a malformed `@@` line there is
///    `None`. Before any file section (a hunk quoted in commit prose) it
///    stays prose.
/// 6. File-level facts producers emit outside hunks become note-only
///    entries: `Only in <dir>: <file>` and standalone `Binary files X and Y
///    differ` (GNU `diff -r`), `* Unmerged path <file>` (`git diff --ours`
///    et al. during a merge; folded into the section git emits for the
///    same path right after it), `Submodule <path> <a>..<b>` headers and
///    `Submodule <path> contains … content` dirty lines. GNU names its
///    files under the roots diff was given, never under prefixes, so
///    `Only in` and `Binary files X and Y` keep those roots whole (`Only in
///    g1/: x` is `g1/x`), matching the sibling header pairs; the X/Y
///    boundary of `Binary files X and Y` is the ` and ` where the sides
///    share the longest tail at a `/` boundary, so a filename containing
///    ` and ` is not cut. A bare (diffutils 3.10) `Only in` whose text
///    holds more than one `: ` splits at the root the stream already
///    named on its echo, header pairs or `Binary files` lines, else at
///    the first. The GNU arms read the English spelling only — GNU diff
///    translates its lines (git translates none of its own) — and a
///    translated one is caught by rule 9, never dropped; any GNU arm
///    firing marks the stream as GNU's for rule 9. Names are decoded per
///    producer: git C-quotes (`"caf\303\251.txt"`, `dequote`) on every
///    line it names a file, GNU diff C-quotes its echo and header lines
///    but shell-quotes `Only in` / `Binary files` names from diffutils
///    3.11 on (`'only '$'\303\251''.txt'`, `"Kyle's notes.txt"`,
///    `unquote_shell`; a quoted directory may itself hold `: `, so the
///    `Only in` split follows the quoting) and prints them bare before,
///    and `* Unmerged path` / `Submodule` lines are never quoted. A
///    decoded name that would split a `[file]` line (a newline) or is not
///    UTF-8 keeps the producer's own spelling, which is lossless. hg's
///    `Binary file <path> has changed` is a binary fact, GNU's `Files X
///    and Y are identical` (`-s`) / `differ` (`-q`) are facts by the same
///    `X and Y` shape, and `Common subdirectories: X and Y` (`diff` on
///    directories without `-r`) is informational and dropped. A submodule
///    both dirty and moved gets two lines and one entry. These arms are
///    suppressed inside an mbox message region (from a `From <sha>`
///    separator to that patch's first file header), where column-0 prose
///    is indistinguishable from them by value — except git's own
///    `Submodule <path> <hex>..<hex>[ (<how>)]:` in that strict shape,
///    which `format-patch --submodule=log` puts where a file section
///    would go.
/// 7. In a stream that carried an mbox `From <sha>` separator, a line of
///    exactly `--`/`-- ` outside a hunk is the format-patch signature
///    separator: prose. This is the single value-keyed exclusion, kept
///    because every patch `git format-patch` emits ends with one; its body
///    (`2.54.0`) is unmarked and needs no region. Streams that never had an
///    mbox separator (plain `git diff`, `diff -u`) get no such tolerance —
///    a bare `--` there falls to rule 8. (Bound: in a malformed mbox stream
///    a stale-budget leftover of exactly `--` is swallowed as a signature;
///    every other leftover value still falls through.)
/// 8. Any other `+`/`-` marked line outside a hunk is evidence of a stale
///    or under-declared budget → `None`, with one exemption: inside an mbox
///    message region (rule 2 separator to that patch's first file header),
///    up to format-patch's diffstat, column-0 marked lines are commit
///    prose — bullet lists, quoted hunks, the `---` separator, version
///    notes between it and the diffstat. From the first diffstat line
///    ([`MBOX_DIFFSTAT_RE`]) on, nothing but diffstat precedes the file
///    header, so a marked line there is a hand-edited or reflowed patch's
///    lost content and falls back raw. That covers a stat-ful patch
///    whichever of its file sections lost its headers, first or last.
///    The stream-start prologue earns no exemption at all: a marked line
///    before the first file header of a never-mbox stream is a
///    head-truncated stream's lost content — with one positional
///    exception: a bare `---` directly followed by a diffstat line is the
///    separator `git log --stat -p` / `git show --stat -p` put between
///    the message and the stat, and a `-<TAB>-<TAB><path>` row is `git
///    log --numstat -p`'s binary-file count; lost content never looks
///    like either.
///    A `--no-stat` patch has no diffstat to end the tolerance, so there
///    the exemption is provisional: it is settled when the region closes
///    (the next rule 2 separator, or end of stream), and only for a region
///    that never reached a file header. Such a region is either bodyless
///    by construction — a cover letter, an `--always` empty commit — or a
///    patch whose whole body lost its headers, and only the second kind is
///    loss. A region that quotes whole hunks in its message is never
///    judged, because it does reach its own file header. The two are told
///    apart by shape, per [`MARKED_PROSE_RE`]: if any line the region
///    exempted is not a prose shape → `None`. (Bounds: a message whose own
///    prose imitates a diffstat line (` name | 3`) ends the exemption
///    early; format-patch's own `---` + diffstat is still read as the
///    stat separator, so only a marked line between the two sends the
///    stream raw — noise, not loss; and an
///    orphaned body whose every marked line happens to be prose-shaped is
///    still dropped, as is a `--no-stat` region that lost one section's
///    headers but kept another's; and a bodyless region whose prose wraps
///    a *short* option to column 0 falls back raw — noise, not loss.)
/// 9. Everything else is prose and is dropped — except in a GNU `diff -r`
///    stream, recognised by the per-file `diff <opts> X Y` echo GNU diff
///    prints whenever it compares directories (rule 3b). Such a stream
///    carries no prose, so a column-0 line no arm read there (a translated
///    `Only in`/`Binary files`, a `File X is a fifo …` note) is a fact the
///    parser cannot read: `None`, since dropping it would lose a whole
///    file silently. A line dropped before the stream was known to be
///    GNU's counts the same way once it is, wherever in the stream it was
///    dropped — GNU sorts its output, so an `Only in` or a text section
///    may well parse before the fact it could not read, and the `diff`
///    echo or a fact arm may settle the question only afterwards. hg's
///    echo does not count a prologue drop against the stream (`hg log -p
///    --template` prose is not a fact). (Bounds, noise not loss: a
///    column-0 line of prose shaped `diff -u old new` outside a message
///    region reads as a GNU echo and sends a git stream raw; a templated
///    multi-changeset `hg log -p` goes raw at its second changeset
///    header; a bare two-file `diff -u a/f b/f` with no echo cannot be
///    told from git's `a/`/`b/` prefixes and is stripped; a slash-less
///    or multi-component `--src-prefix`/`--dst-prefix` is cut at the
///    first `/`, so such names keep or lose a component inconsistently.)
///
/// Every rule reads the line through [`structural`] (ANSI- and CR-stripped);
/// content is pushed from the raw line, so a `--color` stream parses while
/// escapes that are part of the user's content survive verbatim.
