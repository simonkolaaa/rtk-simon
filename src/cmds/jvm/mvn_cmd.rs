///   lane when its line is also a genuine module-establishing line
///   ([`is_lane_opener`]); otherwise it falls back to ownership rules like a
///   raw line.
/// - `[LEVEL] …` (single bracket, Maven's own unprefixed output — the tag
///   itself is the level, with more content after it) → `(Some(""), line)`,
///   root-keyed.
/// - bare `[LEVEL]` (trailing whitespace tolerated; no `"] "` substring at
///   all — the daemon-prefixed trail terminator, e.g. `[INFO] ` or, once
///   `"] "` is absent, just `[INFO]`) → `(Some(""), line)`, root-keyed.
///   Keeps the root lane's blank-terminator contract (`is_blank_separator`)
///   intact.
/// - any other `[`-leading line (bracket-shaped but neither of the above —
///   e.g. `[boom] weird bracket assertion line`, `[1, 2] != [1, 3]`, or a
///   bare `[1, 2]`/`[boom]` with no `"] "` substring at all — a
///   bracket-leading fragment of a multi-line assertion message, not
///   Maven's own output) → `(None, line)`, raw. `Lanes::raw_owner` decides

///
/// `daemon` gates this whole lane layer (cold-preclear finding, upstream PR
/// #3199, third review round): plain `mvn` never interleaves module output —
/// there is nothing for lane tracking to protect against, and the bracket
/// heuristic above is exactly what let an SLF4J/Logback `[%thread] [%level]

// ── Surefire block filter ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Shared state machine driving the inner Surefire block + failure-trail
/// behaviour for `filter_surefire` and `filter_package`. Each filter wraps it
/// with its own outside-block keep logic (`[WARNING]` dedup, module-banner
/// keep, `keep_continuation` for compile-error continuations, etc.) which is
/// applied on the [`SurefireStep::Passthrough`] arm.
///
/// Inner machine responsibilities:
///   - `[INFO] --- … @ … ---` plugin banner skip
///   - `[INFO] Running <FQN>` opens a buffered block (flushes any prior open
///     block as keep — happens on truncated output)
///   - in-block buffering until the next CLOSE line
///   - CLOSE with `Failures > 0` or `Errors > 0` → yields
///     [`SurefireStep::FailingClose`] so the outer loop can decide whether to
///     emit (this seam enforces [`MAX_MVN_FAILING_CLASSES`])
///   - failure-trail handling for the exception/user-frame trail Surefire 3.x
///     emits **after** the close line, terminated by a blank line. Framework
///     frames (junit, jdk.proxy, java.base, etc.) are stripped from both the
///     buffered block and the trail; user-code frames are preserved.
///   - multi-failure classes: Surefire 3.x emits one blank-separated detail
///     block per failing test under a single CLOSE line. When a trail ends at
///     a blank line, `trail_rearm` remembers the keep/drop decision so the
///     next per-test subline re-enters the trail with the same decision.
///     End-of-input with `trail_rearm` still `Some` is harmless (nothing
///     pending in `out`); `finish()` / `flush_open_block_as_keep` need no
///     special handling.

///   fresh budget. Plain `mvn` has no reactor-wide sharing concept; there is
///   only ever one (root) lane, so there is nothing to share *between*.
/// - **mvnd** (`daemon == true`): **reactor-wide within one generation**, not
///   per module — a parallel reactor emits one summary block per failing
///   module, and each module's *first* summary in a generation shares that
///   generation's one running budget: a 20-module reactor still keeps at

///   the modules' summaries interleave or run back-to-back. But `mvn
///   verify`/`install` runs Surefire's summary then Failsafe's as two
///   independent generations — a new generation gets a fresh `cap`. The
///   boundary between generations is an explicit phase marker
///   ([`FailuresSummaryCap::observe_plugin_banner`]), not lane-repeat
///   inference (cold-preclear finding, upstream PR #3199, third review
///   round): inferring "new generation" from a lane's header *repeating*
///   silently failed to reset the budget when a module's only failures were
///   integration-test ones — its Failsafe header was its first-ever
///   sighting, never a repeat, so it shared whatever Surefire's phase had
///   already spent (potentially zero) instead of a fresh `cap`.
///
/// The *dropped-entry count* backing each `… +N more failures` tail is
/// **per lane** ([`SurefireLane::dropped`]) in both modes — the budget says
/// how many entries total may survive, but which module's entries got
/// dropped while spending that budget is per-module information, and each
/// module's own tail must report only its own drops, flushed at its own AGG
/// line. Reactor-wide `dropped` (an earlier design) let whichever lane's AGG
/// happened to arrive first flush *everyone's* outstanding drops under its
