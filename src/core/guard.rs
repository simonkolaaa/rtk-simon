//! Never-worse output guard: RTK never emits more tokens than the raw command.
//!
//! Two callers are allowed past it. `rtk diff` prints a one-line message for a
//! difference `str::lines()` cannot render — CRLF against LF, or a missing
//! final newline — where the raw fallback is two blobs that look identical and
//! answer the question worse at any size. The exception is bounded by the case
//! rather than by a token count: it fires only when the bytes differ and the
//! line vectors do not, so the message never competes with a change list. A
//! fixed allowance above raw was tried and could not be met by construction:
//! the shortest form of the message is ~20 tokens and a one-line pair is ~2, so
//! the ceiling sat under the message's own floor and dropped it on 90% of
//! one-line pairs.
//!
//! The other is a clean run of a command whose output format rtk injected
//! (`runner::RunOptions::clean_outputs`): ruff's `[]` answers a question the
//! user never asked, so the filter's summary is shown although it is longer.
