#![cfg(unix)]
//! End-to-end coverage for `Commands::Test` routing.
//!
//! `rtk test` doubles as a wrapper around a test runner and as the POSIX `test`
//! utility. The unit tests in `main.rs` cover `is_native_test_expression` on its
//! own; these run the binary so an inverted or removed branch in the `Commands::Test`
//! arm fails here instead of shipping.
