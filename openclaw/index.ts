/**
 * RTK Rewrite Plugin for OpenClaw
 *
 * Transparently rewrites exec tool commands to RTK equivalents
 * before execution, cutting up to 90% of the bash output that reaches the LLM context.
 *
 * All rewrite logic lives in `rtk rewrite` (src/discover/registry.rs).
 * This plugin is a thin delegate — to add or change rules, edit the
 * Rust registry, not this file.
 *
 * Permission model: RTK owns the deny gate, OpenClaw owns approval.
 *
 * The plugin runs `rtk rewrite` with `RTK_REWRITE_HOST=openclaw`, which tells
 * RTK that this host applies its own exec policy (`tools.exec.mode`,
 * `security`, `ask`) to whatever the hook returns. RTK therefore stops raising
 * a prompt of its own for a command that matched no rule — without that, every
 * rewritable command raised a second approval prompt, sourced from Claude
 * Code's settings files, on a runtime that never opted into them (#3908).
 *
 * An explicit `ask` rule the user wrote is not that: it still arrives as exit
 * 3 and the plugin still prompts, so a rule the user typed is not discarded.
 *
 * A deny rule is unaffected and still blocks the call. The host name relaxes
 * only the *default* ask; see `ApprovalOwner` in src/hooks/decision.rs.
 *
 * Exit code protocol for `rtk rewrite`:
 *   0 + stdout  Rewrite it — OpenClaw's exec policy decides whether it runs
 *   1           No RTK equivalent → pass through unchanged
 *   2           Deny rule matched → block the call
 *   3 + stdout  Rewrite it, but require approval — an explicit `ask` rule, or
 *               any ask/default on an rtk that predates RTK_REWRITE_HOST
 *
 * The host travels in the environment rather than in argv on purpose: an rtk
 * that does not know a `--host` flag folds it into the command text it judges,
 * so a deny rule written against the user's command stops matching. An rtk
 * that does not know the variable ignores it and behaves exactly as it does
 * today. Nothing here requires a minimum rtk version.
 *
 * See: src/hooks/rewrite_cmd.rs, src/hooks/decision.rs
